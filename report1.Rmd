This is an R Markdown document to create a report for Coursera-Replicable Research Course. The document uses the activity dataset to complete Assignment 1 in Week 2. 

First, I will read the data which comes as a csv file. I will first load the foreign package and explore the data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(foreign)
mydata<-read.csv("activity.csv")
head(mydata)
str(mydata)
```

##step 1
First, I will generate a histogram of total steps per day. I will start by loading the packages, then I will calculate the sum of steps by day, and finally I will create a histogram

```{r}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
data2 <- mydata %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(sumsteps= sum(steps)) %>% na.omit()
hist(data2$sumsteps, main="Total Steps by day", breaks=30)
```

Now, report the mean and median number of steps taken by day.
```{r}
mean(data2$sumsteps)
median(data2$sumsteps)
```
