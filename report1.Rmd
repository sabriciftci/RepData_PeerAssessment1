```


This is an R Markdown document to create a report for Coursera-Replicable Research Course. The document uses the activity dataset to complete Assignment 1 in Week 2. 

1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
First, I will read the data which comes as a csv file. I will first load the foreign package and explore the data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(foreign)
mydata<-read.csv("activity.csv")
head(mydata)
str(mydata)
```

I will generate a histogram of total steps per day. I will start by loading the packages, then I will calculate the sum of steps by day, and finally I will create a histogram

```{r}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
data2 <- mydata %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(sumsteps= sum(steps)) %>% na.omit()
hist(data2$sumsteps, main="Total Steps by day", breaks=30)
```

Now, report the mean and median number of steps taken by day.
```{r}
##mean
mean(data2$sumsteps)
##median
median(data2$sumsteps)
```

2. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
load the libraries in case, I will use ggplot so also load this package
Calculate the mean by interval and then generate a line plot

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
##first, drop the missing values
data2<-na.omit(mydata)
##then get the averafges in a new data
data3<-data2 %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(avsteps=mean(steps))
##Create the plot
 ggplot(data3, aes(x=interval, y=avsteps)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Average Steps by Interval") + xlab("Interval")+  ylab("Average Steps")
